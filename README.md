-DESCRIPTION: This project include 167 countries. The data has important attributes such as child mortality, health and gdpp. In this project, we are going to analysis and clusters countries based on their scores taken from the data by putting countries into clusters according to some factors and find out the ones that has the worst conditions and which ones that reached the standarts and such as. Also, we will check the growth of underdeveloped countries' socioeconomic scores by years.
